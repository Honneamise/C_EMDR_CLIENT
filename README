Example source code for an EMDR consumer client in C.

This example consist of 3 files :
- main.c (my source code example)
- cJSON.c and cJSON.h ( a "self contained" JSON parser library by Dave Gamble)
People can use the JSON parser library they prefer, i have added cJSON just to have an example working "out of the box".

I know there are a lot of comments in "main.c", but my goal was to create a really simple step by step demonstration .

The code works without the need of any change on Linux (Debian with gcc) and on Windows (MSVC 2010 Express Edition).

In both case the pre-requisites are a working development environment for ZMQ lib and ZLIB.
(Setting up this kind of environment it is not covered in this guide, in case of need I will be happy to help)

-ON LINUX :
Put the files of the attachment in a folder and compile with :
"gcc main.c cJSON.c -L/usr/local/lib -lzmq -lz"
It will produce the classic executable "a.out" ready to run

-ON WINDOWS :
In MSVC create a new empty project, add the repository files as existing items and link both zmq lib and zlib

-NOTE ON WINDOWS :
-If the compiler give warnings about unsafe functions, add "_CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS" in the pre-processor definitions
-If for your future projects you need also to include "windows.h" include it AFTER "zmq.h"
-You need to use ZMQ lib 4.1.0 or later that fix this bug : https://zeromq.jira.com/browse/LIBZMQ-569
